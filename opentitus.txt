OpenTitus is an open source environment to play Titus the fox, with better modification possibilities.

OpenTitus isn't finished yet, there are much work left on it, but be patient.....

OpenTitus will make use of a new file format, MFL, which is based of different modules, and a combination of these.

A quick estimate of the current state of the project, Oct 1st, 2010
Initial plan - 100 %
Make the specs for the MFL file format - 80 %
Make a data structure that fits MFL - 80 %
Make a MFL file parser - 0 %
Make MFL internal working code - 10 %
Analyze and import the game engine - 5 %
Audio player - 80 % (misses a better emulator, sound effects and speaker audio)
